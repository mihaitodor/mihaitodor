# DISCLAIMER

I have a personal policy against any type of live coding or online coding tests during interviews and I don't enjoy or engage in any form of competitive programming. Otherwise, I am happy to work offline on coding assignments with reasonable goals and deadlines and to have in-depth technical discussions about software architecture and design as well as relevant technologies.

### Work opportunities

I am looking to work on computational biology research and explore topics such as immunotherapy for cancer, genome engineering, epigenetic clocks and the underlying mechanisms of biological ageing. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you're interested in bouncing around project ideas or starting a collaboration.

I am also available for freelance and consulting work in the data space, including data science, ETL, data streaming, scalability and cloud infrastructure. Among the tools and technologies I specialise in and I enjoy using, Golang, Python, C++, Kubernetes and Docker are my top picks.

In my spare time, I am a contributor to [Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev), the Golang stream processor of choice for mundane data engineering tasks. Besides new features, enhancements and bug fixes, I also dedicate a generous amount of time for community support, knowledge sharing and promotion.

I support diversity and want to work in an environment which treasures empathy and equality above all else.
